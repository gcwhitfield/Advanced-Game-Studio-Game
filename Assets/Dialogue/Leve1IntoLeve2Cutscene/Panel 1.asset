    soon.\n[DAUGHTER]\nBut dad, I\u2019m not done yet! I need to stay here longer.\n[FATHER]\nThis
    isn\u2019t up for debate, come on.\n[DAUGHTER]\nYou never let me do what I want,
    you know I\u2019m a big girl now, I should be able to stay here.\n[FATHER]\nThat's
    just not true, you get plenty of freedom, but right now we need to head home.\n[DAUGHTER]\nNo.
    you decide everything for me. When to sleep, what to eat, when I can go see my
    friends. I'm staying here for longer and you can't stop me.\n[FATHER]\nNo, wait!
    Don't go!"
